# Introduction

Monitoring of ecologically important marine habitats (gravel beds) and benthic communities by analysis of videos recorded by a towed underwater video system.

[Project description](https://biifsweden.github.io/projects/2024/07/02/AI4Life_OC2_2024_11/)

[Download code](archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Installation

You can clone the repository and create an environment from the environment file included as follows.

```
git clone git@github.com:BIIFSweden/AI4Life_OC2_2024_11.git
cd AI4Life_OC2_2024_11
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

Once the environment is created, you can open the prompt, activate the environment and start jupyter lab.

```
conda activate ai4life_11
jupyter lab
```

Inside the `notebooks` folder you will find notebooks for:

- [Automatic mask generation](notebooks/automatic_mask_generator.ipynb)

- [BIIGLE point to polygon generation](notebooks/BIIGLE_point_to_polygon_with_sam.ipynb)

- [Paparazzi point to point generation](notebooks/paparazzi_point_to_polygon_with_sam.ipynb)

- [Plotting and saving masks for many images](notebooks/Plot_masks_with_sam-batch.ipynb)

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we showed how to perform semantic segmentation of objects in images with [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).
